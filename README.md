## 🌟 About Me

- 🔧 4.5+ years of experience in developing features for a premium core banking solution at Edgeverve.
- 📚 🧭 I took a 5-year deep dive into the world of governance, philosophy, economics, and ethics through UPSC prep — and emerged more curious and mission-driven than ever.  
Now I'm blending that macro perspective with my coding skills to build tech that matters.
- 📚 I write poetry and blog occasionally.
- 📚 I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from BITS Pilani (2020)
- 📚 I also have a Master's degree in Political Science (2023) 
- 🚴 Training for a 10K run + love cycling on weekends to get back to fitness
